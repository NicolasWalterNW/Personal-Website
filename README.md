# Nicolas Walter - Personal Website

This is my personal website, built with Nuxt and TailwindCSS, hosted with Vercel.

## Forking this repo and using my code

Yes, you can use my code for own projets! I love to share my work online and having my site open source, but pliagiarism is something I can't stand. It's always sad whenever someone simply copies ressources without giving credit. I spent a good amount of time and effort building and designing my website, and I am really proud of it! So if you use my code, feel free to credit in your project!

## Installation & Set-up

1. Install all dependencies
```sh
npm install
